<p>      To assess how the effects of Universal VBM varies by preexisting mail voting rates, I test whether the effects of Universal VBM differ between the counties below the median pre adoption rate compared to those above the median.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I re-estimate the same baseline model used by Thompson et al. with county and election-year fixed effects. However, I interact the treatment variable with an indicator if a treated state had below the median share of mail voters pre-treatment.</p>

<p>      Next, I test if effects of universal VBM on democratic voteshare differs between high and low VBM pre-implementation counties. Thompson et al. found weak a small partisan effect in their baseline specification (just county and election year fixed effects) that I reproduce (limiting the data to Washington State) in column 1 below.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The second column shows that this effect is entirely driven by counties with high preexisting vote by mail rates. Adding the interaction term with the main VBM term yields an estimate of 0.00 percentage points. This suggests that the lack of partisan effects in Thompson et al. is not due to the average county’s high preexisting rates of vote by mail.</p>

<p>      Overall, I find weak evidence that universal vote by mail differs much between counties that had lower levels of vote by mail before making it universal compared to those with higher levels. Any partisan effects are even smaller in low pre-implementation VBM counties, and turnout might be slightly higher. All things equal, this should add to the evidence that universal VBM will not cause dramatic changes in turnout or composition of the electorate.</p>
<li id="fn2"><p>Thompson et al. only use data from California for their estimate of how much universal VBM increases the share of ballots cast by mail (columns 3-6 of table 3), which produce slightly smaller estimates.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
