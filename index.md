I am a research associate at the Jain Family Institute where I work on welfare policy and tax issues. Previously, I was a research professional at the [University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/). I got my B.A in Economics and Political Science from [Rutgers University-New Brunswick](https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/) in 2018.
