I am a fellow at the Jain Family Institute where I work on tax and saftey net policy. Previously, I was a research professional at the [University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) working for Professors [Anjali Adukia](https://harris.uchicago.edu/directory/anjali-adukia) and [Yana Gallen](https://harris.uchicago.edu/directory/yana-gallen). I got my B.A in Economics and Political Science from [Rutgers University-New Brunswick](https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/) in 2018.
