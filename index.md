I am a research professional at the [University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) working for Professors [Anjali Adukia](https://harris.uchicago.edu/directory/anjali-adukia) and [Yana Gallen](https://harris.uchicago.edu/directory/yana-gallen). I got my B.A in Economics and Political Science from [Rutgers University-New Brunswick](https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/) in 2018. 

I'm interested in congressional politics, state and local politics, campaign finance, and the politics of criminal justice. I've also done a few Covid-19 related [blog posts](https://jacklandry.github.io/pages/Blog/).
